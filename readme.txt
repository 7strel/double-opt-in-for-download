Improve your client outreach by offering FREE downloads to your visitors in exchange for their email address with our Double Opt-In Plugin

== Description ==

Our Double Opt-In for download plugin is ideal for improving your customer out reach. Simply upload your free upload using the admin
interface. Once the file is uploaded, add the generated shortcode to the pages or posts where you would like to show the sign up form. 
When the subscriber signs up to receive your free download an email with a verification link is sent to their email address. For the 
subscriber to receive the free download they must click on the link in the email. The link returns the subscriber to your website where
the plugin verifies the information and provides the subscriber with a button to retrieve the download. A link to the download is never
revealed.

1. Upload the 'double-opt-in-for-download folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the Double Opt-In for Download plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a landing page for your subscribers and add this shortcode to it, [lab_landing_page].
3. Configure the plugin by going to the "Settings" sub-menu that appears under DOI-Download in your admin menu. Don't forget to select your landing page.
4. Upload your Free download by going to the "Downloads" sub-menu. Give your file a name, attach it, then upload it.
5. Once your file is uploaded, copy the generated shortcode and paste it into the pages and posts of your choosing.
